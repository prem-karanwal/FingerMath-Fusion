# FingerMath-Fusion
The FingerMath-Fusion is an innovative project that leverages OpenCV and computer vision technology to create an interactive learning environment for basic mathematics. This project combines image processing with mathematical problem-solving, making education not only engaging but also hands-on.

- **Finger Counting Detection**:
    Utilizes OpenCV's computer vision and mediapipe library for accurate real-time finger detection.
    Implements image processing techniques to precisely track extended fingers.
- **Mathematical Problem Solving**:
    Incorporates a set of basic equations for users to actively solve.
    Presents interactive challenges to engage users in the learning process.
- **Real-time Interaction**:
    Allows users to input answers by raising the corresponding number of fingers.
    Dynamically assesses and provides instant feedback for a responsive learning experience.
- **Educational Impact**:
    Enhances the educational experience by combining computer vision and mathematics.
    Particularly beneficial for young learners, providing a novel and effective way to reinforce basic arithmetic skills.
